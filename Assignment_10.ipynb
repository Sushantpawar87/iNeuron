The `shutil.copy()` function is used to copy a single file from one location to another. It takes two arguments: the source file path and the destination file path. It copies the file and preserves its metadata.\n","\n","On the other hand, the `shutil.copytree()` function is used to recursively copy an entire directory tree (including all subdirectories and files) from one location to another. It takes two arguments: the source directory path and the destination directory path. It creates a new directory and copies all the files and subdirectories from the source directory to the destination directory.\n","\n","2. The `os.rename()` function is used to rename files. It takes two arguments: the current name of the file and the new name of the file. It can be used to change the name of a file within the same directory.\n","\n","3. The delete functions in the `send2trash` and `shutil` modules differ in their behavior:\n","\n","- The `send2trash` module provides a function called `send2trash()` that moves files or directories to the system's trash or recycle bin instead of permanently deleting them. This allows for a safer deletion process, as the files can be restored if needed.\n","\n","- The `shutil` module provides a function called `shutil.rmtree()` that is used to remove an entire directory tree, including all its subdirectories and files. It permanently deletes the specified directory and its contents without moving them to the trash or recycle bin.\n","\n","4. The equivalent of the File objects' `open()` method for ZipFile objects in the `zipfile` module is the `ZipFile()` constructor. It is used to open a ZIP file and provides access to the contents of the archive.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"tWtSW3-BbIV-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5.
